    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I love being special. Most of the time I express myself through clothes and my personal belongings. However, I discovered I can learn about myself during daily tasks. 
      During High School, I was part of the Student Union, where my role was in charge of recreation. And it was the time that I discovered that I am differnet from others.</p>

    <h1>Uniqueness</h1>
    <p>During my Student Union period, I hosted different events. One time, we assisted teachers in creating booths to enhance students' history knowledge. 
      Thatâ€™s when I realized I am more creative than other members.
    <br>
    We wanted to host booths with different mini-games, each with history questions. However, 
    we thought it was too boring to just make booths, then I came up with more entertaining and innovative ideas.
    <br>
    All students receive a passport booklet. Throughout every mini-event, they received a stamp.
    To further engage students, the passport included different character profiles that students could collect and soon to receive a doll from it. 
    Or once they got all of their passport stamped, they can received different history toys (e.g., Japanese kokeshi dolls, Chinese Jianzi).</p>
