  <h1>Uniqueness</h1>
  <p>During my student union period, I had hosted differents event and one time school hopes we can assist teachers to create booth for enhancing student's history knowledge. And thats the time I realised I am creative </p>
  <p>At first, We all wanted to host booths that contains different minigames and each minigames with history questions. However, I thought it was too boring and came up with a more entertaining and innovative ways. </p>
  <p>All students receive a passport booklet, throughout every mini events they receive a stamp. To further engage students, the passport also includes different character profiles that student can roleplay.Once they got their passport stamped up, they will receive differnt history toys.(e.g Japanese kokeshi dolls, Chinese Jianzi) </p>
