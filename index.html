    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I love being special. Most of the time I express myself through clothes and my personal belongings. However, I discovered I can learn about myself during daily tasks. During High School, I was part of the Student Union, where my role was in charge of recreation.</p>

<section id="unique" class="container mt-4 center-text">
    <h1>Uniqueness</h1>
    <p>During my Student Union period, I hosted different events. One time, we assisted teachers in creating booths to enhance students' history knowledge. Thatâ€™s when I realized I am creative.</p>
    <p>We wanted to host booths with different mini-games, each with history questions. However, I thought it was too boring and came up with more entertaining and innovative ideas.</p>
    <p>All students received a passport booklet. Throughout every mini-event, they received a stamp. To further engage students, the passport included different character profiles that students could role-play. Once they got their passport stamped, they received different history toys (e.g., Japanese kokeshi dolls, Chinese Jianzi).</p>
